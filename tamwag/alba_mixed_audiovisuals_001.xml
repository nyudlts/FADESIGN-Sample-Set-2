<p>In the late 1980s, Daniel Kazimierski donated to the Tamiment Library a group of photographic portraits of veterans from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade he shot and then assembled as a mock-up to promote an idea for a book on this subject (the project was never completed).  In 2013, Mr. Kazimierski donated the remainder of materials that he assembled for this project and a related project (a short documentary film on the same subject).</p>  </acqinfo>

THe film was completed "just after" he began doing the still photography project?  So the film preceded the photography project?  Well, the reel to reel audiotapes that are dated have a March 1984 date on them.  Maybe the two projects overlapped.</p>  </bioghist>
