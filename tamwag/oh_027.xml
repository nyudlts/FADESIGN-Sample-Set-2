    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Interviews were conducted by Gail Malmgreen, NYU students Aimee Kaplan and Nancy Schmarak, and JLC staff member Arieh Lebowitz.  The Jewish Labor Committee was established by a coalition of Jewish unions and fraternal organizations in New York City in February 1934, with the purpose of rescuing and providing material aid to victims of Nazi persecution.  The Committee included affiliates of the United Hebrew Trades, the needle trades unions, the Workmen's Circle, the Jewish Daily Forward Association, and other Jewish labor organizations representing nearly 500,000 members.  Working with the AFL, the CIO and a number of mainstream Jewish organizations, the JLC engaged many forms of anti-Nazi activity, including a boycott of German goods, mass meetings, demonstrations, propaganda and active support for anti-fascist forces, both Jewish and non-Jewish, in Europe.  In 1940, a special emergency visa program which was engineered by the JLC and William Green of the AFL, helped more than a thousand socialists, trade unionists, and intellectuals whose lives were threatened by the Nazis, to find refuge in the U.S.  During the war the JLC worked both through official channels and through the anti-Nazi Underground to channel aid to its friends in Europe, even in Nazi-devastated Poland.  After the war, the JLC assisted concentration-camp survivors and other displaced persons in every way possible. It helped to locate relatives, feed, clothe and resettle refugees and find them new homes and employment.  In the 1950s, with the support of the British, French, and German labor movements, the JLC played a significant role in negotiating reparations claims against Germany.  In the 1960s, the JLC aggressively addressed the issues of civil rights in the U.S. and human rights for Soviet Jewry and supported the grape and wine boycotts called by the United Farm Workers. It remains active as a liaison between the American labor movement and the organized Jewish community, and continues its educational work on anti-Semitism, Holocaust studies, and Jewish culture.   SUMMARY:  The collection contains nineteen interviews. Among the interviewees are  Eleanor Shachner, long-time chair of the JLC Women's Division.  Emanuel Muravchik, who served as the JLC's Executive Secretary from the late 1960's through the early 1980's, discusses his family and political background and the position of the JLC on Middle Eastern issues.  A series of 12 videotaped interviews with historians and JLC veterans were conducted in connection with the Wagner Archives JLC video documentary project. This series includes interviews with Benjamin Gebiner, Joseph Mlotek, Vladka Meed, Gus Tyler, Motl Zelmanowicz and historians Jack Jacobs and Kenneth Waltzer.  The documentary, entitled "They Were Not Silent: the American Jewish Labor Movement and the Holocaust", previewed in 1998.  Index available in repository.
