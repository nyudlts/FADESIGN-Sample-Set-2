    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Tapes were donated to the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives in 1990 after NABET Local 15 joined IATSE.  NABET Local 15 had its origins in the 1940s when the Association of Documentary Film Cameramen organized an independent union.  In the late 1940s, the National Association of Broadcast Engineers, a CIO affiliate, approached the ADFC and gave them a charter.  At that time the name was changed to the Association of Documentary and Television Craftsmen (ADTFC) to accommodate the expanding craft categories to be covered by the NABE union umbrella.  The ADTFC organized film crews working on low-budget and television films, areas not organized by IATSE, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, affiliated with the AFL.  In 1954, most of the 700 members of the ADFTC joined the various locals of IATSE. Those who remained with the ADFTC formed a new union affiliated with the CIO, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.  When the AFL and CIO merged in 1955, IATSE and NABET remained separate entities.  With the increased number of television commercials, series and feature production in the early 1960s, workers previously unorganized by IATSE now organized NABET Local 15, the Association of Film Craftsmen. The new local, formed on September 19, 1965, would organize all the craft positions under one contract, which it felt would be more effective for workers on low-budget productions.  This encouraged Local 15 members to work in more than one craft in any area of production.  NABET was predominantly organized around the television industry; Local 15's charter was one of only three NABET locals devoted to film craftsmen.   By the early 1970s, Local 15 expanded as its members increasingly worked on more feature films.  Regional offices opened the country in Boston, Miami and San Francisco.  In the late 1980s, NABET set up a meeting between officials of IATSE and Local 15 to discuss a possible merger.  Soon after, NABET accused Local 15 of trying to secede.  The International brought charges against Local 15 which subsequently went to court in an attempt to retain its member status as a NABET local.  It lost the case and the international revoked its charter in 1990.  Local 15, membership voted to join IATSE; it was admitted in October 1990.   No inventory is available.</p>  </scopecontent>
