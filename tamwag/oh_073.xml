    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives (OPEL) Oral History Collection includes an ongoing series of life history interviews conducted by graduate students in Professor Rachel Bernstein's oral history classes beginning 1997. Interviews in this collection document the history of work and working-class life in New York City. Topics include undocumented aspects of work and family life, political activism, union activism, immigrant experience, domestic life, public health, and religion. Oral histories are accompanied by brief indices prepared by the interviewers for each recording.
Oral histories added to the collection in 2017 include 18 interviews recorded in 2006 by students in Bernstein's fall 2006 Oral History course at New York University. Students in the course collected interviews from ordinary New Yorkers about their lives in the city. Interviews from the  five students in the course focused on different themes including, life in Stuyvesant Town, gentrification in the Lower East Side, PS. 64 the CHARAS/El Bohio community center, health care on the Lower East Side, and community and class among Chinese immigrants. All interviews were recorded in 2006, and address topics dating from the 1960s to early 2000s.</p>  </scopecontent>
