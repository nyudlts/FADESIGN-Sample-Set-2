    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The National Maritime Union of America (NMU), which represented merchant marine workers, was formed in 1937, as a split from the International Seafarer's Union, which was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). At its first convention in 1937, the NMU joined the Committee for Industrial Organizations (CIO). A crucial role in its formation was played by former members of the Communist-led Marine Workers Industrial Union. Among the notable reforms achieved by the union's Communist-dominated leadership was "checkerboarding," the side-by-side racial integration of sailors' sleeping quarters. By the end of World War II, the NMU had nearly 100,000 members. The union was founded and led by Joseph Curran, who served as NMU president until 1981.</p><p>During World War II, the alliance of Communists and non-communists in the union was weakened by charges that the Communists, in their desire to maximize productivity in order to aid the Soviet Union, did not aggressively defend sailors' interests. The Cold War exacerbated the ideological divide, and in 1948, the NMU's Communist leadership and its allies were defeated in union elections and expelled. </p><p>In 1950, the NMU's Welfare plan was established, providing seamen with health, accident and life insurance benefits. In 1954 a pension component was added. Curran's successor, Shannon Wall, was not well-received by a strong minority of the union, led by James Morrissey. In 2001, the NMU merged with the Seafarers International Union of North America, which originally represented West Coast merchant mariners. </p>  </bioghist>

Individuals pictured include NMU president Joseph Curran, treasurer Ferdinand Smith, Mayor Fiorello Laguardia and photographer Berenice Abbott. Several prints, with corresponding contact sheets and negatives, appear to have been taken over the course of a single day inside the NMU's hiring hall in New York City, possibly in the 1970s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref20" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><unitid>cuid15007</unitid><unitdate normal="1940/1979" type="inclusive">circa 1940s-circa 1970s</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_55eb5df428317ce8080b3b4073b3df3b" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_73812ad914cc42f138815403f4358c48" parent="aspace_55eb5df428317ce8080b3b4073b3df3b" type="folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Portraits of NMU and Labor Leaders</unittitle><unitid>cuid15008</unitid><unitdate normal="1940/1950" type="inclusive">circa 1940s</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_a2410bd2f0341e6d3904d9fb6704e09d" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_954eda1676e65d2a102dc8bc45d2c003" parent="aspace_a2410bd2f0341e6d3904d9fb6704e09d" type="folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Maritime Day (1 of 2)</unittitle><unitid>cuid15009</unitid><unitdate normal="1944/1944" type="inclusive">1944</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_6bffa5acb0cd56344d1cb20b20d26e08" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_37af5a7119607157db1634e7afe232c2" parent="aspace_6bffa5acb0cd56344d1cb20b20d26e08" type="folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref12" level="file"><did><unittitle>Maritime Day (2 of 2)</unittitle><unitid>cuid15010</unitid><unitdate normal="1944/1944" type="inclusive">1944</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_0230d332c1f74c3d2eba38413997a0aa" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_a066ef73bdbaf7c848be9bcff61c6003" parent="aspace_0230d332c1f74c3d2eba38413997a0aa" type="folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref13" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Safety At Sea" Exhibit</unittitle><unitid>cuid15011</unitid><unitdate normal="1940/1949" type="inclusive">circa 1940s</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_e6ff998044f7175b6917a9b30ecae55e" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_ee6839c153c5e96746f30f00c77d8556" parent="aspace_e6ff998044f7175b6917a9b30ecae55e" type="folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref14" level="file"><did><unittitle>[Miscellaneous NMU Photos (Includes ships, mess hall, demonstration against Westbrook Pegler, Christmas Party)]</unittitle><unitid>cuid15012</unitid><unitdate normal="1940/1949" type="inclusive">circa 1940s</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_ef5f53303bc388f929a0aa732fb5547c" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_94258bbab0422dde95a8a8a2d911d133" parent="aspace_ef5f53303bc388f929a0aa732fb5547c" type="folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref17" level="file"><did><unittitle>General [(Includes Hiring hall "shape-up"; NMU 6th Convention)]</unittitle><unitid>cuid15013</unitid><unitdate normal="1940/1959" type="inclusive">circa 1940s-circa 1950s</unitdate><container altrender="Flat OS Box - 17" id="aspace_307d2bcaca1d51f141f4d869ca8cb907" label="Mixed Materials [31142062759785]" type="box">OS001</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref16" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series II: Economic Cooperation Administration Photos by Ernst Haas</unittitle><unitid>cuid15014</unitid><unitdate normal="1948/1952" type="inclusive">circa 1948-1952</unitdate><container altrender="OS Flat Box 15.5" id="aspace_ec1bc4bdd04d1d0ce60300e283ed6968" label="Mixed Materials [31142062758100]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_31067ef5371ef8baadad8a5e721d4eb6" parent="aspace_ec1bc4bdd04d1d0ce60300e283ed6968" type="folder">7</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_4fe4e2bcecf186b74ca5cc1253f00e25"><head>Historical/Biographical Note</head><p>Ernst Haas (1921-1986) was born in Vienna and took up photography after World War II. His first widely published pictures depicted returning prisoners of war in Austria and brought him to the attention of <emph render="italic">Life</emph>  magazine, which published his photo essay "Homecoming." At the invitation of Robert Capa, Haas joined the cooperative Magnum Photos in 1949, developing close associations with Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Werner Bishof. In 1951 Haas moved to New York and continued to take black and white assignments for magazines while experimenting with color film. His color photo essay of New York City was published in <emph render="italic">Life</emph> in 1953 and was a turning point in the acceptance of color photography as an art form and abstraction as a photographic style. Haas became president of Magnum in 1959. Throughout his career, he worked in photojournalism, advertising, and as a still photographer for films, bridging the gap between photojournalism and the use of photography as a medium for artistic expression. He wrote four books during his lifetime, including "The Creation" (1971).</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_027df5caf9a61297e61f07d130f5858f"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>The series contains 32 black and white prints made by photographer Ernst Haas, possibly between 1948 and 1952, for the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), the administrative arm of the Marshall Plan.
