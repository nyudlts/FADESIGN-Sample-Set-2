    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) was founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA. The CPUSA played an important role in the labor movement, particularly in the building of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, in struggles for civil rights for African Americans, while its cultural initiatives attracted a number of prominent artists and intellectuals, and its struggles to attain and maintain its legality were an important chapter in the history of U.S. civil liberties. The Central Control Commission (which later, i.e., ca. 1940, became the Central Review Commission) of the Communist Party was responsible for internal Party discipline of both individual Communist and Party units.</p>  </bioghist>
