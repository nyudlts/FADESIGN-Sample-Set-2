    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Sidney J. Gluck was born in 1916. He was an outspoken public advocate and had a long career in business, education, and the arts. Gluck began his business career in the 1930s in the textile industry, and during World War II he was responsible for a number of developments including the introduction of the heat set method to stabilize uneven nylon fibers for parachutes and initiating spun glass/fiber laminates with epoxy for bullet-proof vests. He later established his own company Malibu Textiles, which was a leading innovator in rubber thread stretch fabrics, and won several textile-related patents during this period. He retired from the textile industry in the mid-1970s.</p><p>Sidney Gluck was also an educator and public advocate. He was the Chairman of the Economics and Politics Department of the Jefferson School of Social Science; an adjunct Professor of Economics at Ramapo College School of Social Relations; and a member of the Social Science Faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York for twenty years. He also taught at textile institutes including Parsons School of Design, Fashion Institute of Technology, Philadelphia College of Textile Science, and the New York School for Interior Design.</p><p>As a political advocate, Gluck was involved in a number of campaigns including: organizing opposition to exorbitant bail for political defendants; organizing the Live and Let Live movement which was used by President Nixon in opening relations with China; serving a treasurer of committees for Medical Aid to Cuba and Chairman of the Emergency Committee for Disaster Relief to Cuba after Hurricane Flora in 1963, and encouraging public opposition to USA invasion and occupation of Grenada during the Cold War. He was Co-Director of World Fellowship of Faiths with Dr. Willard Uphaus from 1957 to 1967 and served as the President of the Sholom Aleichem Memorial Foundation as of 2014.</p>  </bioghist>
