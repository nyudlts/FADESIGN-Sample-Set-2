    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Murray Zuckoff was the editor-in-chief of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) from 1969 to 1987. In his columns, he wrote on a wide range of issues, including Israel, poverty, black-Jewish relations and the about way Jewish issues were covered in the general media. Zuckoff was born on New York City's Lower East Side and was a reporter at Paterson, N.J's <emph render="italic">The Morning Call</emph> before joining to JTA. He later served as an editor of <emph render="italic">Midstream</emph> magazine. He was also a founding member of the Jewish Liberation Project and was a member of Socialist Workers' Party. He died in New York of lung cancer in 2004. </p><p>Aviva Cantor Zuckoff was a journalist, activist, and editor. Born in the Bronx in 1940, Cantor served as an editor for many Jewish periodicals including <emph render="italic">Israel Horizons</emph>, <emph render="italic">Jewish Liberation Journal</emph>, <emph render="italic">Hadassah Magazine</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Lilith</emph>, which she helped found in 1976. An advocate for Jewish feminism, Zionism, socialism, animal rights and environmentalism, Cantor published five alternative haggadahs aimed at creating more inclusive Jewish ceremonies, including her most well known, the <emph render="italic">Egalitarian Haggadah</emph>.</p><p>Murray Zuckoff and Aviva Cantor Zuckoff were both founding members of the Jewish Liberation Project, a 1960s-era radical group that some say presaged the Jewish counterculture of the 1970s.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection name was changed in 2016 to the Muray Zuckoff and Aviva Cantor Zuckoff Papers, when Aviva Cantor Zuckoff was identified as an additional creator of materials in the collection. 33 boxes, which are part of the original donation and make up the bulk of the collection, have not been aranged and have little description. Four boxes of these boxes were separated from the original donation and established as the Jewish Liberation Project Files (TAM 369). These materials were reincorporated into the Murray and Aviva Cantor Zuckoff Papers (TAM 325) in 2016. </p><p>An additional two boxes were added to the collection following a 2016 donation and described in the file list as 2016 Accretion. </p>  </processinfo>
