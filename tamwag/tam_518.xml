    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Michael Ratner is an attorney whose work has focused on human rights abuses in the United States and abroad. He was born in Ohio in 1943. He received a BA from Brandeis University and his law degree from Columbia University, and has credited his time at Brandeis for encouraging his political activism. Ratner worked for many years at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), a non-profit human rights litigation organization. Through the CCR, Ratner worked on first federal lawsuit in the Attica Brothers vs. Rockefeller, which took up the case of Attica prison inmates. He later served as principal council in a suit to close a detention camp for HIV-positive Haitian refugees at the United States' military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Throughout Ratner's long career with the CCR he has served in a number of leadership positions including legal director, vice-president, and eventually president. He has also worked as a lecturer at Yale and a professor at Columbia Law School and has served as legal advisor to notable individuals including Julian Assange of Wikileaks.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>This collection was received in multiple donations. The first donation received in 2009 consists of 74 boxes and was rehoused into archival boxes. Two of these boxes (Box 95 and Box 96) contain mold and have been placed in the Quarantine Room. There are an additional 6 boxes among these materials for which there is no acquisition information. It is unclear whether these boxes came as part of the original donation or a later accretion. </p><p>14 additional boxes were added to the collection in 2 accretions in 2016. Materials from these donations were added as the following subseries: Spring 2016 Accretion and Fall 2016 Accretion in a new series titled: Accretions. In 2017 an accretion of 4 boxes was added as the subseries 2017 Accretion. Materials have been rehoused into archival boxes, and retained in their original groupings. Any items that were loose in the boxes have been placed in archival folders, but no attempt has been made to rearrange folders or materials within the boxes.</p><p>Disk images of born-digital items in 2016 and 2017 accretions were made at the time of accessioning.</p><p>In July 2017 a box level inventory was created for the collection, including the original donation (2009) and the accretions (2016 and 2017). Loose materials found in the boxes have been placed in archival folders, but no attempt has been made to rearrange folders or materials within the boxes. Born-digital and audiovisual materials have been separated from their original boxes and consolidated into two boxes (Box 73 and Box 90). A separation sheet was placed in the original box and folder of the born-digital/AV item(s), and a second separation sheet was placed with the born-digital/AV item(s) in the new box. These materials are also described in the inventory.</p><p>In September 2017, 11 boxes were added to the collection as the subseries September 2017 Accretion. At the time of acccessioning these materials were described at the series level and listed in a box-level inventory. Items in this accretion have not been arranged by an archivist.  CD-Rs and DVD-Rs containing audio recordings were moved to box 90 and separation sheets were placed in their original locations.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains the personal and professional papers of human rights attorney Michael Ratner. The 2009 donation consists of 74 boxes. These materials relate to Ratner's work with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and his work more generally in human rights law and human rights activism. Materials include notes, articles, case summaries, research, correspondence, audiovisual material, and born-digital material related to legal cases on a wide array of international human rights topics. Materials also include files containing correspondence, drafts, articles, and research related to conferences, public forums, and publications. Some documents contained within these boxes may be protected by attorney-client privilege. </p><p>9 boxes of Ratner's papers were added to this collection in 2016. Before sending these materials to Tamiment, Ratner removed any documents protected by attorney-client privilege. These documents primarily consist of Ratner's research files between 1993 and 2015, which include newspaper clippings, journal articles, legal briefs, and documents on international law. Ratner's research files focus on a handful of specific topics including the detention of HIV-positive Haitian refugees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, violations of habeas corpus following the September 11th terrorist attacks, the Patriot Act, the United States War on Terror, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They also contain a small assortment of emails between Ratner, attorneys, and other human rights activists. There are several drafts of articles for scholarly publication as well as a variety of legal briefs, memoranda, motions, and court orders. Many of these materials relate to Ratner's work with the Center for Constitutional Rights.</p><p>5 boxes added to the collection in the fall of 2016 consist of notes and drafts related to Ratner's publications and research.  Included among these materials are handwritten and typed notes, outlines, research, and drafts of books and articles on US intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean. They also include research files on former CIA agent Philip Agee from the 1970s and 1980s. There is also an assortment of his correspondence and writing on human rights issues between 2010 and 2014. </p><p>An additional 4 boxes added to the collection in 2017 include Ratner's notes, articles, case summaries and correspondence related to legal cases between 1995 and 2006 on a wide array of international human rights topics including, terrorist actions against the Cuban government, United States immigration policy, the United States' War on Terrorism, the arrest of Augosto Pinochet, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It also includes files containing correspondence, speech drafts, and articles related conferences and public forums on human rights law between 2005 and 2009.</p><p>There are an additional 6 boxes in the collection, which arrived prior to the 2016 donation. It is unclear whether these boxes were part of the original donation or a previous accretion. No acquisition information exists for these boxes.</p><p>An additional 11 boxes added to the collection in 2017 include clippings and research materails related to the United States War on Terror. They largely consist of newspaper clippings, legal articles,  copies of international law, notes, drafts of articles, and correspondence. This donation also includes a small amount of material documenting Ratners work on the radio program Law and Disorder and collected articles written about Ratner by others. </p>  </scopecontent>
