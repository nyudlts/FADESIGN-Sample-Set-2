    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Ralph Shapiro joined the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) after World War II. The NLG was founded in 1937 as an association of progressive lawyers and jurists who believed that lawyers had a major role to play in reconstructing legal values by emphasizing human rights over property rights. The Guild is the oldest and most extensive network of public interest and human rights activists working within the legal system.</p>  </bioghist>
