    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jeremy "Jez" Bold is a librarian who has been actively involved with the Occupy Movement since its inception in New York City. He was involved with the organization New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts (NYABC) and their occupation near City Hall called Bloombergville in June 2011, which protested the city's proposed cuts to education and social services. Due to his affiliation with NYABC, Bold attended the Speak-Out and People's Assembly at Bowling Green Park on August 2, 2011, a gathering which was later recognized as the first General Assembly for Occupy Wall Street. Inspired by the artistry of protestors at Bloombergville, Bold proposed the creation of an OWS Arts and Culture Working Group at the Second General Assembly. Bold continues to spearhead the development of an OWS archive as a member of the Archives Working Group.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street materials collected by Jeremy Bold and other individuals involved with the movement provide insight into the movement's motivations and goals, organizational structures, and diverse membership. The collection consists mostly of printed ephemera and organizing materials related to the various branches of the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Most of the materials were generated by branches of the movement in New York City, but there are also materials from the movements in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Seattle. Also included are notes from meetings of the NYC Occupy Wall Street working groups, especially the Structure and Archives Working Groups. There are several large posters and pieces of artwork created for various Occupy marches and other events. The collection also contains several publications regarding the Occupy movement, both third-party coverage and publications generated by the movement itself. </p><p>To a lesser extent, the collection includes publicity and organizing materials related to other social justice causes, such as immigration and housing rights, and informational materials on anarchism. There are also some materials generated by the organization New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts (NYABC), which organized an occupation near NYC's City Hall called Bloombergville in June 2011, and an offshoot Occupy group called Occupy Museums.</p><p>Researchers may find the following list of abbreviations useful when determining where materials were generated or collected:</p><p>#M1GS = May 1 General Strike
