    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Bill Davis (1942- ) is a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and an employee of the New York City Department of Welfare (later Social Services) from the late 1960s through 1995. After graduating from Columbia University (New York), Davis began his work with the NYC Department of Welfare. Shortly after starting, however, Davis was drafted to fight in the Vietnam War, where he spent two years in Germany. After the war, he resumed his work at the Department of Welfare, and motivated by his time in service, joined the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) in 1971 as a way to address the social and economic inequalities he considered to be plaguing the United States at the time. After retiring from social work in 1995, Davis became a full time volunteer for the CPUSA and has served as a delegate to national conventions, a member of the National Committee and National Board, and as a District Organizer for the state of New York. As of 2016 he is the manager of the Communist Party of the United States' headquarters building at 235 W. 23rd Street in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>
