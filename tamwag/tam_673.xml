    <abstract id="aspace_602dad75878d475c12662c9e3d1072c8">The Rebel Arts Group formed in 1934 within the Rand School of Social Science. Its members produced plays, music, murals, dance performances, and other graphic materials to both further socialist endeavors and explore the intersection of art and political engagement. The group's graphic works employed a bold, colorful aesthetic and were created using screen printing techniques. This collection consists of silkscreen banners and placards produced by the cooperative during the period of 1936-1939 for use at May Day parades and other demonstrations. Included at 5 placards on chipboard and 13 banners on linen. Prominent themes and topics present in these graphic materials include worker solidarity, child labor, racism, and unionization. In addition to the content, the materials in this collection document arts activism activites, as well as the aesthetic sensibility of the Rebel Arts Group, its affiliated members, and a portion of the The Socialist Party during the 1930s.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Rebel Arts Group formed in 1934 within the Rand School of Social Science. Its members produced plays, music, murals, dance performances, and other graphic materials to both further socialist endeavors and explore the intersection of art and political engagement. Notable members included Socialist Party officer Samuel H. Friedman, Harry Herzog, Alex Haberstroh, and Fairfield Porter. Although the Rebel Arts Group may be best known for the cover art to the <emph render="italic">Rebel Song Book</emph>, the group also produced and disseminated numerous graphical works that were used during demonstrations. The group's graphic works employed a bold, colorful aesthetic and were created using screen printing techniques. Common themes and messages present include working-class solidarity, union organization, ending child labor, anti-facism, and anti-racism.</p>  </bioghist>
