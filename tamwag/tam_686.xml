    <abstract id="aspace_316e08c2af901eafb8520d7bdcd39e61">The Kenneth Toglia Papers on the Tompkins Square Park May Day Riot (dates 1990-1994) consist of one box of police reports and court documents related to the arrest of Kenneth Toglia and other activists during the 1990 Tompkins Square May Day Riot. Kenneth Toglia (also spelled Tolia) is a New York City activist who was involved in squatting and housing rights activism in Manhattan's Lower East Side in the late 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, Toglia and 29 other people were charged with inciting a riot after violence erupted during the Fourth Annual Squatters' May Day Festival in Tompkins Square Park. Papers in this collection include copies of court documents and police reports related to the arrests of Toglia and other activists involved in the incident. The collection also contains several folders of materials related to activist and attorney William Kunstler. These materials do not relate to the event in Tompkins Square Park, but rather appear to have been compiled for a book on Kuntsler's work. They consist of his speeches and articles, as well as a handful of documents related to the book.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Kenneth Toglia (also spelled Tolia) is a New York City activist. Toglia moved to New York City with his mother in the 1980s. He grew attracted to the punk rock scene in Manhattan's Lower East Side, became involved in squatting and housing rights activism in the neighborhood. In 1990, Toglia was among 29 people arrested during the Fourth Annual Squatters' May Day Festival in Tompkins Square, which ended in a riot. Toglia was charged with inciting a riot for his participation in the event and sentenced to 1 year in prison. He and several of the other individuals arrested were among a group of activists, anarchists, and squatters who had participated in the better known Tompkins Square Riots in 1988.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Kenneth Toglia Papers on the Tompkins Square Park May Day Riot (dates 1990-1994) consist of one box of police reports and court documents related to the arrest of Kenneth Toglia and other activists during the 1990 Tompkins Square May Day Riot. Half of the papers in this collection relate directly to the riot, arrests, and subsequent trials. These documents include copies of police reports, witness testimony, legal motions, and correspondence with law firms. The other half of the collection contains documents related to attorney William Kunstler that may have been compiled for a book about Kunstler's work. Kunstler's firm provided legal support to defendants in the Tompkins Square Park riot cases, but he did not directly represent Toglia. Documents related to Kunstler include copies of his speeches and writings, and a small amount of correspondence from his editor Michael S. Smith.</p>  </scopecontent>
