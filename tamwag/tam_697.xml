    <abstract id="aspace_57b092bfdb8fcdcdec31b2ac6b39d2e9">Michi Kobi (1924-2016) was a Japanese American actress and activist who was interned at the Topaz War Relocation internment camp in Utah during World War II. The Michi Kobi Papers consist of correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs, and drafts of her writings. Correspondence predominantly relates to Kobi's study of Japanese American history and the internment of Japanese Americans, and includes letters to personal friends, scholars, and activists in the Japanese American community. Kobi's writings include multiple drafts of an untitled novel about Japanese Americans in San Francisco, research files on Japanese Americans, and drafts of her unpublished memoir about her experience at the Topaz internment camp. The collection also contains photographs from Kobi's visit to the Topaz historic site in the 1980s and audio recordings of conferences and meeting on Japanese internment.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Michi Kobi (1924-2016), born Machiko Okamoto, was a Japanese American actress and activist. During World War II, she was sent to the Topaz War Relocation internment camp in Utah with other Americans of Japanese descent. She turned to acting while in the camp and after the war pursued an acting career in New York, appearing in film and Broadway productions. Kobi also worked to draw attention to the injustices of internment, and in 1980 served as the co-chairman of the East Coast Japanese Americans for Redress. The organization advised the federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians and helped organize the November 1981 commission hearings in New York City, which eventually led to a formal apology from Congress in 1988 for the evacuation and internment of Japanese American citizens.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Michi Kobi Papers consist of correspondence, newspaper clippings, subject files, and drafts of her writings. Correspondence predominantly relates to Kobi's study of Japanese American history and the internment of Japanese Americans, and includes letters to personal friends, scholars, and activists in the Japanese American community. Many of these materials relate to Kobi's involvement in the campaign for Reconciliation and Redress for Japanese Americans interned during WWII. They include her writings about the experience of Japanese Americans and internment, research files on US policy toward Asian Americans, papers and programs from Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) conferences, correspondence, and notes from public events focused on redress.
