From 1979 until 2011 the museum supported the Native Film + Video Film Festival to focus on the creative works, concerns, and achievements of Native filmmakers. The first Festival's success led to the creation of the museum's Film and Video Center (FVC) and of a published reference catalog that was drawn from Festival programming, Native Americans on Film and Video, Vol. I (1981) and Vol. II (1988).</p>  </bioghist>
