    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) was organized in 1900 and had its hay day in the 1930s and 1940s.  At the time of its creation many in the needle trades were Jewish immigrants, many of whom were sympathetic to various radical movements. The ILGWU campaigned for better working conditions and fewer hours.  After the first World War, this amalgamation of seven local unions was one of the largest and most successful unions in the US, with 100,000 members in 1920.  During the Depression membership declined even with an influx of women workers in the garment trades (64 percent in 1925 to 74 percent in 1935).  New Deal labor policies and the special relationship the ILGWU had with Eleanor Roosevelt benefited the union.  Under the leadership of David Dubinsky (1932-1966) the now progressive union gained the respect of the manufacturers and members alike-- membership rose to 200,000 in 1934 and to 300,000 by 1942.</p><p>After World War II ILGWU membership declined as the union won few gains in workers' wages and benefits and gradually lost its ability to keep sweatshop conditions from returning.  In addition, in ILGWU strongholds such as New York, the predominately male Jewish and Italian leadership became alienated from its constituency as membership drew from the new wave of immigrants from China, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic and manufacturing increasing moved abroad. The ILGWU merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1995 to form the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) which in turn merged with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union to form UNITE HERE in 2004.</p>  </bioghist>
