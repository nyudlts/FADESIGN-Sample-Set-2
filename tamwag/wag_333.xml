<p>The collection consists of four delegate badges from the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th annual conventions of the Textile Workers of America. The United Textile Workers of America (UTW) was formed in 1901 as an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). UTW famously organized a textile worker strike in the 1930s to protest poor working conditions during the Great Depression.Two badges are embellished with printed images and all are embellished with beaded appliqu√©. The conventions occured on the following dates: the 6th on October 16, 1906 in Patterson (sic), NJ; the 7th on October 14, 1907 in Providence, RI; the 8th on October 20, 1908 in Cohoes, NY; and the 9th on October 19, 1909 in Washington, DC.</p>  </scopecontent>
